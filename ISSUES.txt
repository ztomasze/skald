## Queen's Heart

WontFix
+ feed verb
* "glammer" should probably be "glamour" or "glamor".
  * "glammer" -- used by Stephen King in the Dark Tower series
  * "glamer" -- used by D&D 3.5 (and possibly other editions)


## Fate

WontFix:
+ Skald: Not every illogical (currently impossible) action is grayed out  
  * More customizing would be req on TADS side
  * Some subtlety regarding illogicalness and overriding default library: removing clothes
+ Skald: Add Enter as verb, so can move from locations through Objects menus
  * Should add Exit too, then.
  * Some weird Enter behavior to be fixed: can try to Enter street from within phone booth, but get weird response and no result
  * Will require some tweaking to drop doors from the list.

## TADS-Skald

* Skald: *** The End *** (from TADS) redundant with THE END (Skald)
  * Fixable within server.h

## GWT-Skald
