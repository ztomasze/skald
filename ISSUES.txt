## Delivery

Issues:
* A "stage 3" where can play any of the games one more time?
* Skald: damn scrolling to bottom
  * this.mainScroller.ensureVisible(response);  ??
  

## Queen's Heart

WontFix
+ feed verb


## Fate

WontFix:
+ Skald: Not every illogical (currently impossible) action is grayed out  
  * More customizing would be req on TADS side
  * Some subtlety regarding illogicalness and overriding default library: removing clothes
+ Skald: Add Enter as verb, so can move from locations through Objects menus
  * Should add Exit too, then.
  * Some weird Enter behavior to be fixed: can try to Enter street from within phone booth, but get weird response and no result
  * Will require some tweaking to drop doors from the list.

## TADS-Skald

* Starting server still buggy depending on context
  * Must specify network security level of 0.  (-ns0 in t3run, -N0 for Frob)
  * Recommend you run with plain output on server side (-plain in t3run, -i plain for Frob)
  * Often won't start
    * check that nothing else is already on that port
    * Needs hostname set, but cannot set it manually in code as a string under many systems.
      * Ex: Under t3run, server won't start.  Under HTML TADS, starts, but get empty CMDs received.
    * Running locally?  Need to use getLocalIP().  This seems to work even if you are connecting using 'localhost' in your browser.  (TADS HTML will grab 127.0.01, but t3run will grab your external IP.  But still work as if 'localhost') (getLaunchHostAddr() does not work locally.)
    * Works for me on deployment.  
    * If server does not start or does not reply to CMDs, try manually setting skaldServer.hostname with your server's domain name before you call skald.start()

* on invalid command (ie, an unknown adjective used), no reponse.  But error message appears at start of next turn.


## GWT-Skald

* gameOver: true/false field in in footer
  * Gives the definite indiction that the game has ended, allowing the UI to respond appropriately

* scroll to top of new response (not to full bottom)
* Skald: *** The End *** (from TADS) redundant with THE END (Skald)

* order's separators
* bug: toggling game control tabs
? demo game fleshed out
* bug: doesn't seem to collapse properly when dirObj is same; in this case, prep and iobj aren't HORIZ collapsed.  Eg, Give > your costume > to > Benny
                     > your ordinary clothes > to > Benny
? Do not highlight an object after all if it it has no affordances to display
  * Or, if do highlight to indicate, do it slightly differently (as per disabled).
