## Delivery

* timestamps into log files (start and end, optionally for each command)
  * No, track this in delivery script: start page -> next Page
  * start time (consent start), first play time, (review start), second play time, (review start)
  * times for "closed window" quit
  * webUI in all of this?
* both log formats -> replayable -> recorded transcript
* timeout works
* install: port works and reachable, timeout still works
* delivery script
* deploy

## Queen's Heart

WontFix
+ feed?

## Fate

WontFix:
+ Not every illogical (currently impossible) action is grayed out  (again, a bit more customizing would be req on TADS side; subtlty regarding illogicalness and overriding default library: removing clothes)
+ Add Enter as verb, so can move from locations through Objects menus
  * Should add Exit too, then.
  * Some weird Enter behavior to be fixed: can try to Enter street from within phone booth, but get weird response and no result
  * Will require some tweaking to drop doors from the list.

## TADS-Skald

* on invalid command (ie, an unknown adjective used), no reponse.  But error message appears at start of next turn.

WontFix (for now)
+ Inventory listings don't get linked
+ Not every mention is linked.  This is due to authoring.  Highlight same color not yet implemented.


## GWT-Skald

* gameOver: true/false field in in footer
  * Gives the definite indiction that the game has ended, allowing the UI to respond appropriately

* scroll to top of new response (not to full bottom)
* order's separators
* bug: toggling game control tabs
? demo game fleshed out
* bug: doesn't seem to collapse properly when dirObj is same; in this case, prep and iobj aren't HORIZ collapsed.  Eg, Give > your costume > to > Benny
                     > your ordinary clothes > to > Benny
? Do not highlight an object after all if it it has no affordances to display
  * Or, if do highlight to indicate, do it slightly differently (as per disabled).
