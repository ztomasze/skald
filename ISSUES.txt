## Queen's Heart

* Add links to text with skald.a

## Fate

? Add Enter as verb, so can move from locations through Objects menus
  * Should add Exit too, then.
  * Some weird Enter behavior to be fixed: can try to Enter street from within phone booth, but get weird response and no result
  * Will require some tweaking to drop doors from the list.

WontFix:
+ Inventory listings don't get linked
+ Not every mention is linked.  This is due to authoring.  Highlight same color not yet implemented.
+ Not every illogical (currently impossible) action is grayed out  (again, a bit more customizing would be req on TADS side; subtlty regarding illogicalness and overriding default library: removing clothes)


## TADS-Skald


## GWT-Skald

* gameOver: true/false field in in footer
  * Gives the definite indiction that the game has ended, allowing the UI to respond appropriately

* scroll to top of new response (not to full bottom)
* order's separators
* bug: toggling game control tabs
? demo game fleshed out
* bug: doesn't seem to collapse properly when dirObj is same; in this case, prep and iobj aren't HORIZ collapsed.  Eg, Give > your costume > to > Benny
                     > your ordinary clothes > to > Benny
