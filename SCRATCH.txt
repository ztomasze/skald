Windows, indexed 0, 1, 2...
0 == Main window, others optional.
Each window sends a verb and displays the reply.
Does this every turn.
Game replies to idempotent verb with list of verbs that are idempotent.
User can created windows not guaranteed to be idempotent, with warning.  Basically, each window runs the same command each turn and displays corresponding output
(Might also have "idempotent [verb]" that would run an idempotent version of that command.)

Might also need a filter between front and end back end to filter/read stuff from like banner windows and the like.
